# subElements
A website templating framework to quickly and easily build platforms.

Licenced by the [Subnodal Open-Source Licence](LICENCE.md).

## Building
To build subElements, you must have
[subPack](https://github.com/Subnodal/subPack). If you have it, run in the main
directory:

```bash
$ subpack
```

You should then have the bundled and minified version of subElements in
`build/subelements.min.js`.
